# Recreating Visualizations from Ischemia-Reperfusion Single-Cell Study
## Overview
This project aims to reproduce plots from the study titled _Ischemia-reperfusion responses in human lung transplants at the single-cell resolution_ (Wong et al., 2024). During transplantation, blood restoration to the donor tissue causes an adverse reaction called ischemia-reperfusion (IR) that results in tissue damage, leading to post-transplant mortality. The primary goal of the paper was to further elucidate the molecular mechanisms of IR through single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) analysis. Understanding the underlying mechanism of IR can inform the development of effective therapeutic interventions. 

## Description of Dataset
The dataset was obtained from the NCBI GEO Database with accession key: GSE220797. Biopsies were performed on the donor lungs of 6 patients at two timepoints 1) at the end of cold preservation and 2) two hours after reperfusion. Thus, the dataset contains 12 samples in total (6 from each timepoint).
