# Recreating Visualizations from Ischemia-Reperfusion Single-Cell Study
## Overview
This project aims to reproduce plots from the study called _Ischemia-reperfusion responses in human lung transplants at the single-cell resolution_ (Wong et al., 2024). During transplantation, blood restoration to the donor tissue causes a paradoxical reaction that results in tissue damage.
