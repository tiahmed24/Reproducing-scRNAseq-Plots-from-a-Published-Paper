# Recreating Visualizations from Ischemia-Reperfusion Single-Cell Study
## Overview
This project aims to reproduce plots from the study titled _Ischemia-reperfusion responses in human lung transplants at the single-cell resolution_ (Wong et al., 2024). During transplantation, blood restoration to the donor tissue causes an adverse reaction called ischemia-reperfusion (IR) that results in tissue damage, leading to post-transplant mortality. The primary goal of the paper was to further elucidate the molecular mechanisms of IR through single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) analysis. Understanding the underlying mechanism of IR can inform the development of effective therapeutic interventions.
